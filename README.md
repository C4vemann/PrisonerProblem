# PrisonerProblem
Prisoner Problem:
* There are 100 prisoner that have not talked to each other besides 1 meeting before hand for an hour to discuss the following situation
* The warden of the jail will release all the prisoners if the prisoners determine if all 100 of them were picked
* They can only communicate with a light switch

Answer:
* There must be a manager to determine if all of them went, with him being the last one
* A prisoner will flip the light switch on the first time he is picked, only if the light is switched off, if he gets picked again then he will not flip the switch
* The manager counts the amount of times the switch is flipped whenever he gets choosen to enter the room, and will flip the light switch off if the switch is on (reseting the light for the next person)
